## Project Description

AirSafe is a web application that helps students and athletes make safer decisions about outdoor activities by showing real-time air quality conditions and local weather for a searched location. Users can view pollutant readings (e.g., PM2.5/PM10 where available) from OpenAQ monitoring stations, combine that with current weather from OpenWeather, and save favorite locations for quick access.

## Target Browsers

AirSafe is designed for modern desktop browsers:

* Google Chrome (latest)
* Microsoft Edge (latest)
* Mozilla Firefox (latest)
* Safari (latest on macOS)

Mobile browsers (iOS Safari / Android Chrome) should work for basic viewing, but the primary target is desktop.
